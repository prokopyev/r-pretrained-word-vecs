```

## Step 1: Setting Up in R

First install and load necessary R packages and the dataset for out analysis. We’ll use a dataset of US politicians’ social media posts, labelled by Figure Eight (formerly CrowdFlower) (https://www.figure-eight.com/data-for-everyone/). We will focus on predicting the presence of partisan political bias in senators and representatives’ tweets and Facebook posts.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rio)
library(text2vec)
library(tokenizers)

df_orig <- import("assets/Political-media-DFE.csv")

str(df_orig)
```

## Step 2: Data Preparation

```{r}
cat("Parsing comments...\n")

it <- df_orig %$%
  str_to_lower(text) %>%
  str_replace_all("[^[:alpha:]]", " ") %>%
  str_replace_all("\\s+", " ") %>%
  itoken(tokenizer = tokenize_word_stems)

vectorizer <- create_vocabulary(it, ngram = c(1, 1), stopwords = stopwords("en")) %>%
              prune_vocabulary(term_count_min = 3, 
              doc_proportion_max = 0.5, 
              vocab_term_max = 4000) %>%
              vocab_vectorizer()

m_tfidf <- TfIdf$new(norm = "l2", sublinear_tf = T)
tfidf <- create_dtm(it, vectorizer) %>%
         fit_transform(m_tfidf)  
```

```{r}
library(text2vec)
# we are interested in words which are in word embeddings
voc = create_vocabulary(rownames(vecs))
# now we will create document-term matrix
vectorizer = vocab_vectorizer(voc)
dtm = itoken(d, tokenizer = word_tokenizer) %>% 
  create_dtm(vectorizer)

# normalize - calculate term frequaency - i.e. divide count of each word 
# in document by total number of words in document. 
# So at the end we will receive average of word vectors (not sum of word vectors!)
dtm = normalize(dtm)
# and now we can calculate vectors for document (average of vecors of words)
# using dot product of dtm and embeddings matrix
document_vecs = dtm %*% vecs
```


























## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
